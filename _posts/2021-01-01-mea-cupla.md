Lol, yeah, provided so much help.  :)

Well, this is me acknowledging that I haven't been doing a good job of returning knowledge back to the PowerShell community.  Sad for me to look back and see that I set this up two years ago and haven't done much with it.  Hoping to change that a little.  Been working on some home project stuff lately (not always PowerShell related) that would be good for me to document and to get out there how I accomplished some technical challenges.  First post will be around Synology / Docker / IPv6.  I am also going to do some exploration into Jenkins and how that product works (we use TFS / Azure DevOps at work) so that I can broaden my learning and understanding of that ecosystem.  I also want to dive a little more into C# since PowerShell seems to be a gateway drug into that programming language.  So, more to come!  Hopefully we will see some more regular updates this year (at least that is the desire).
